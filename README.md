## source-data
The source data in this repository consists of scans of beer labels 
that have been peeled off of purchased beer. Files that are labeled 
'raw' have not been modified from the initial scan. Other files have
been cropped or rotated to fix orientation.

### source-data naming convention
Files are labeled all lower case in the format 

> breweryname-beername-labellocation-status

Brewery name and beer name should be self apparent. Label location 
refers to either front, rear, neck, or all depending on the data
represented. Status reflects raw or some other state of modification.
